# C++ - a basic tutorial for researchers

Goal of this tutorial is to teach fundamental concepts about C++ that enable writing fast,
readable, and maintainable code.

## Tutorials
Clone this repository to your computer using:
```
git@github.com:roman-ellerbrock/cpp-tutorial.git
```
The tutorial only requires CMake >=2.8 and GCC (tested on 9.3.0).
If you're running the tutorial on Martinez' groups server Fire, 
you can load the dependencies via
```
module load GCC/9.3.0
```

Build the repository using CMake
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
Now you should have binaries for the lecture code and the tutorials.
